If you've been holding off on getting an Apple Watch Series 2 in hopes of scoring the running-oriented Nike+ edition, you only have a few more days to wait. Apple has updated its product page to reveal that Apple Watch Nike+ will be available on October 28th, just in time to meet the company's promised late October launch window. You can get the wristwear in both 38mm and 42mm case sizes at the same $369 and $399 prices as standard Series 2 watches, with a mix of black and gray straps that sometimes include highly visible (and slightly eye-searing) green accents.

As we found out when trying the Nike+ watch in September, you're really buying this for the software. You get both Nike's running app out of the box as well as a pair of exclusive watch faces geared towards athletics. The more breathable straps are helpful if you can't stand a sweaty wrist at the end of a workout, but not as essential. You're otherwise going to experience the same performance, GPS and water resistance as a run-of-the-mill Series 2. In short: while it might be the Apple Watch of choice if you rarely go a day without running, it's not so essential for everyone else.
